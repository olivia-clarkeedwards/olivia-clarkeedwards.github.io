      <h3 class="welcome">tech blog 1: unwrapping the box</h3>
      <p>
        A blog post on <span class="emphasize">margins</span>,
        <span class="emphasize">borders</span> and
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>introduction</h4>

      <p>
        Ahhhhh, layouts and design in the box model. I have spent the last two
        days wrestling with paddings and margins as my content rushed around the
        page and all that freneticism could have been saved had I thought of
        this simple analogy to remember what
        <span class="emphasize">margins</span>,
        <span class="emphasize">borders</span> and
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> are about.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">Margins</span>,
        <span class="emphasize">borders</span>,
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> and
        <span class="emphasize">content</span> make up the box model in CSS, and
        whats the best kind of box, I ask? To which you reply, a Christmas
        present, of course!
      </p>

      <p>
        Working our way outside in as one does with any good present we will
        discuss <span class="emphasize">margins</span> which are like the gaps
        between multiple presents, <span class="emphasize">borders</span> which
        are the pretty wrapping paper that seperates what is inside the present
        from outside AND makes it look pretty,
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> which acts as the box which holds
        the present and creates space around the present to protect it, and last
        but least, <span class="emphasize">content</span> which we can thing of
        as the present itself...
      </p>

      <p>we finally made it, hurray!</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>margins</h4>

      <img src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/margin-image.jpg" />

      <p>
        Like the gaps between presents,
        <span class="emphasize">margins</span> help us to differentiate between
        different areas of content by creating transparent gaps between them,
        like the way we separate presents (as seen in the image above) so we can
        see clearly distinguish what belongs to who and not get our gifts mixed
        up (I don't know if my baby nephews socks would do me much good,
        although I suppose he could wear my socks as a strange sort of hat)!
      </p>

      <h4>demo: no margins</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/margin-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo"
      /><img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/margin-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo"
      />

      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">Note</span> (that I figured out while creating
        this demo):
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are using inline-block elements and are NOT using flex, make sure
        there is no white space between your html elements if you do not want
        ANY <span class="emphasize">margin</span> in between them!
      </p>

      <h4>demo: margins</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/margin-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin"
      /><img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/margin-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin"
      />

      <p>
        These images each have an added <span class="emphasize">margin</span> of
        20px.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>borders</h4>

      <img src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/border-image.jpg" />

      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">Borders</span> create a delineation between the
        outside world and inside content, just as wrapping paper seperates what
        is outside a present from what is inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other way that <span class="emphasize">borders</span> are like gift
        wrapping is that they come in many styles and colours, adding a
        stylistic touch to emphasise how exciting the content really is!
      </p>

      <h4>demo: no border</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/border-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin"
      />

      <h4>demo: borders</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/border-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-border"
      /><img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/border-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-styled-border"
      />
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>padding</h4>

      <img src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/padding-image.jpg" />

      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">Padding</span> is like a box which creates space
        around our content, just as we might put a present in a box to stop it
        from getting crushed. This space stops our content from getting crushed,
        although, as we can see in the demo, adding
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> does shrink our content down if
        we are using border-box for our box sizing (this would require a whole
        other post to explain, so just take my word for it)!
      </p>

      <p>
        As we can see if we compare our two demo images, if we add a lot of
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> to our content like the image on
        the right, it's like the fun trick of putting a really small present
        inside a really big box... so I might think I'm getting adult sized
        socks when I see the packaging, when in fact, I am getting my baby
        nephew's socks which are like a miniature copy of my own.
      </p>

      <h4>demo: no padding</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/padding-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-border"
      /><img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/padding-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-styled-border"
      />

      <h4>demo: padding</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/padding-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-border add-padding"
      /><img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/padding-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-styled-border add-more-padding"
      />
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>content</h4>

      <img src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/content-image.jpg" />

      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">Content</span> is, you guessed it, the most
        important part of the whole package. Without
        <span class="emphasize">content</span>, would we have a gift at all?
        <span class="emphasize">Content</span> <em> is </em> the real gift, not
        just wrapping, or decoration or empty space. This is where the real
        value lies, and it is the element that all the other properties exist to
        enhance.
      </p>

      <h4>demo: content</h4>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/content-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin add-border add-padding"
      />

      <h4>demo: no content</h4>

      <p></p>
      <p></p>

      <p class="single-paragraph">...but for the sake of the analogy...</p>

      <img
        src="./blogpost-images/html-css-images/crumbs-image.jpg"
        class="margin-demo add-margin"
      />
    </section>

    <section>
      <h4>coding</h4>

      <p>
        Coding <span class="emphasize">margins</span>,
        <span class="emphasize">borders</span> and
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> is fairly straight-forward. Each
        can be refered to by a simple key word "margin", "border" or "padding".
        Used alone, this keyword will control all four sides of an element,
        however, "top", "bottom", "left" and "right"strong> may be adding before
        the keyword to control a more specific value, e.g., "padding-top".
      </p>

      <p>
        While <span class="emphasize">margins</span> and
        <span class="emphasize">padding</span> are transparent,
        <span class="emphasize">borders</span> demand a "border-width",
        "border-style" and "border-color". These may be specified individually
        or in shorthand, e.g. "border: 5px dashed green", will result in a
        dashed green border with a width of 5 pixels.
      </p>

      <p class="stripped" id="coding-example">
        this element has a padding-top of 50px with the rest having a padding of
        10px, a margin of 100px and a 10px double border in the accent colour of
        this web page
      </p>
