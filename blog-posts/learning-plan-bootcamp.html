      <h3 class="welcome">core blog 6: my bootcamp learning plan</h3>

      <p>
        This plan re-evaluates my initial <span class="emphasize">goals</span>,
          <span class="emphasize">commitments</span> and
          <span class="emphasize">expectations</span>, with the specific lens of entering <span class="emphasize">bootcamp</span> at
          DevAcademy.

      <h4>goals and career pathway</h4>

      <p>
        Additional to my goals, stated in my foundations learning plan (get a job making amazing products and make heaps of money), I would like…
      </p>

      <p>
        …to work as a full-stack or backend software developer. I would love to get an opportunity to write Python and/or Java and build my knowledge of those languages. 
      </p>

      <p>
        …to work alongside people that I connect with and who inspire me. 
      </p>

      <p>
        … to work on open source initiatives that promote access to knowledge and media. 
      </p>

      <p>
        …to  develop a simplified screenless phone / fashion accessory called the OSE FONE with a very basic operating system, that is restricted to calls, messages and maps (personal project).
      </p>

      <p>
        …to be fulfilled and happy - I don’t have to code for the rest of my life if I don’t want to! But, as long as it is mentally stimulating and I am passionate about it, I want to keep learning and growing and building my craft as a developer!
      </p>
        
      <p>
        …to never settle for a workplace or position that does not bring me joy and uplift me. 
      </p>

      <h4>strengths and limitations</h4>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Strengths:</span></p>

      <p>
        I think that I would continue to stand behind my initial evaluation of my strengths. Additional to those, I think that I have noticed that I have a strength for connecting with people, and this is something that brings me joy. I love to work around people. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I think I am also developing a strong sense of optimism and passion in a more general way. I have always had this periodically, but I think some healing in terms of my mental health has created space for this to exist in a more consistent way within me.
      </p>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Limitations:</span></p>

      <p>
        I continue to be slightly nervous around working directly with people and in teams, but I am also very excited about developing this skill, and not letting it be a limitation going forward. 
      </p>

      <h4>biggest non-tech challenge</h4>

      <p>
        I think one of my biggest non-tech challenges will be managing my inner critique and the unhealthy level of demand that I place on myself. While I would like to excel, I must always remind myself that I am in a learning environment, and that I am not expected to be the best at anything, or to even be good at things at this point. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>skills to develop</h4>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my communication skills, I want to be able to break down complex concepts to my peers without having to just show them how exactly to do the code. How can I practice helping others by guiding them conceptually rather than just telling them what I did, or what I would do? 
      </p>

      <p>
        I would also like to develop some leadership skills, eek. This terrifies me, because although it often falls upon me to take leadership roles especially in group work, I would usually prefer not to hold the responsibility required of these roles. However, I would like to work on how I can manage my own expectations of myself, and manage the responsibilities of others without taking them onto myself completely. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>bootcamp team</h4>

      <p>
        I would like to feel appropriately supported and challenged. That is, I expect the availability of support or help when challenges arise, but I also expect to be pushed, or encouraged to push myself if I am sitting further within my comfort zone. I want to maximize my growth throughout this process, and any guidance, support and encouragement will be highly appreciated. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>expectations of myself</h4>

      <p>
        I will try to request tech-ins or check-ins as needed. I will ask for help if I am stuck on a problem for an unreasonable stretch of time - I might discuss this with some of the facilitators when I am on campus. Obviously this will depend on the task at hand - I imagine that with some tasks I would like to give myself a little longer to try and figure them out myself, whereas others, I should perhaps just ask right away. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned in my previous learning plan, I intend to keep a reasonably strict routine when it comes to managing my times during bootcamp. I intend to continue balancing my studies with physical exercise, in order to look after my mind and body. I will be sure to check in with friends and take breaks when needed.
