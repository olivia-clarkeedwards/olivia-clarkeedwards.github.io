      <h3 class="welcome">core blog 6: my bootcamp learning plan</h3>

      <p>
        This plan re-evaluates my initial <span class="emphasize">goals</span>,
          <span class="emphasize">commitments</span> and
          <span class="emphasize">expectations</span>, with the specific lens of entering <span class="emphasize">bootcamp</span> at
          DevAcademy.

      <h4>goals and career pathway</h4>

      <p>
        Additional to my goals, stated in my foundations learning plan (get a job making amazing products and make heaps of money), I would like…
      </p>

      <p>
        …to work as a <span class="emphasize">full-stack</span> or <span class="emphasize">backend</span> software developer. I would love to get an opportunity to write <span class="emphasize">Python</span> and/or <span class="emphasize">Java</span> and build my knowledge of those languages. 
      </p>

      <p>
        …to work alongside <span class="emphasize">people</span> that I connect with and who <span class="emphasize">inspire</span> me. 
      </p>

      <p>
        … to work on <span class="emphasize">open source initiatives</span> that promote <span class="emphasize">free access</span> to knowledge and media. 
      </p>

      <p>
        …to  develop a <span class="emphasize">simplified screenless phone</span> / fashion accessory called the OSE FONE with a <span class="emphasize">basic operating system</span>, that is restricted to calls, messages and maps (personal project). There is a company called <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/" target="_blank">Light Phone (click to see more)</a> that has made a similar product - perhaps I could work for them. 
      </p>

      <p>
        …to be <span class="emphasize">fulfilled</span> and <span class="emphasize">happy</span> - I don’t have to code for the rest of my life if I don’t want to! But, as long as it is <span class="emphasize">mentally stimulating</span> and I am <span class="emphasize">passionate</span> about it, I want to keep learning and growing and <span class="emphasize">building my craft</span> as a developer! If I can get bored, I can just go into academia and be a philosopher, hehe. 
      </p>
        
      <p>
        …to <span class="emphasize">never settle</span> for a workplace or position that does not bring me <span class="emphasize">joy</span> and <span class="emphasize">uplift me</span>. 
      </p>

      <h4>strengths and limitations</h4>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Strengths:</span></p>

      <p>
        I think that I would continue to stand behind my initial evaluation of my strengths. Additional to those, I think that I have noticed that I have a strength for <span class="emphasize">connecting</span> with people, and this is something that brings me joy. I love to work around people. 
      </p>

      <p>
        I think I am also developing a strong sense of <span class="emphasize">optimism</span> and <span class="emphasize">passion</span> in a more general way. I have always had this periodically, but I think some healing in terms of my mental health has created space for this to exist in a more <span class="emphasize">consistent</span> way within me.
      </p>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Limitations:</span></p>

      <p>
        I continue to be slightly <span class="emphasize">nervous</span> around working directly with people and in teams, but I am also very <span class="emphasize">excited</span> about developing this skill, and not letting it be a limitation going forward. 
      </p>

      <h4>biggest non-tech challenge</h4>

      <p>
        I think one of my biggest non-tech challenges will be managing my <span class="emphasize">inner critique</span> and the unhealthy level of demand that I place on myself. While I would like to excel, I must always <span class="emphasize">remind myself</span> that I am in a <span class="emphasize">learning environment</span>, and that I am not expected to be the best at anything, or to even be good at things at this point. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>skills to develop</h4>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my <span class="emphasize">communication</span> skills, I want to be able to break down complex concepts to my peers without having to just show them how exactly to do the code. How can I practice helping others by <span class="emphasize">guiding them conceptually</span> rather than just telling them what I did, or what I would do? 
      </p>

      <p>
        I would also like to develop some <span class="emphasize">leadership</span> skills, eek. This terrifies me, because although it often falls upon me to take leadership roles especially in group work, I would usually prefer not to hold the <span class="emphasize">responsibility</span> required of these roles. However, I would like to work on how I can manage my own expectations of myself, and manage the responsibilities of others without taking them onto myself completely. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>bootcamp team</h4>

      <p>
        I would like to feel appropriately <span class="emphasize">supported</span> and <span class="emphasize">challenged</span>. That is, I expect the availability of support or help when challenges arise, but I also expect to be pushed, or encouraged to push myself, if I am sitting further within my comfort zone. I want to <span class="emphasize">maximize my growth</span> throughout this process, and any <span class="emphasize">guidance</span>, <span class="emphasize">support</span> and <span class="emphasize">encouragement</span> will be highly appreciated. 
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>expectations of myself</h4>

      <p>
        I will try to request tech-ins or check-ins as needed. I will <span class="emphasize">ask for help</span> if I am stuck on a problem for an unreasonable stretch of time - I might discuss this with some of the facilitators when I am on campus. Obviously this will depend on the task at hand - I imagine that with some tasks I would like to give myself a little longer to try and figure them out myself, whereas others, I should perhaps just ask right away. 
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned in my previous learning plan, I intend to keep a reasonably <span class="emphasize">strict routine</span> when it comes to managing my times during bootcamp. I intend to continue balancing my studies with physical exercise, in order to look after my <span class="emphasize">mind</span> and <span class="emphasize">body</span>. I will be sure to check in with friends and take breaks when needed. 
      </p>
