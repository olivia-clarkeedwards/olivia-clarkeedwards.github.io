      <h4>three things I’ve learnt about myself and my ego</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">control and perfectionism </span>
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve become more aware of my need to <span class="emphasize">control</span> everything by <span class="emphasize">attempting perfection</span>, trying to be the best, or by making sure I’ve ticked all the boxes; I keep my <span class="emphasize"></span>expectations of myself very high. This stems from a <span class="emphasize">fear of external criticism</span> - instead my own negative internal voice ensures that I am ‘good enough’ by telling me that I won’t be good enough if I don’t try so hard. I cling to an <span class="emphasize">ego</span> constructed from <span class="emphasize">‘success’</span> at the things that I do.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span class="emphasize">creating habits</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since starting Dev Academy I have started <span class="emphasize">morning habits</span> of <span class="emphasize">yoga</span>, <span class="emphasize">running</span>, <span class="emphasize">muay thai</span> and <span class="emphasize">mindfulness</span>… I have been flossing my teeth everyday (that’s new haha). I really connected with Fogg’s Behavior Model  - build habits incrementally, connect them to existing routines, and reward yourself. I have used this to help me start building multiple habits already. For me, the greatest thing about this model is that it really breaks down huge abstract goals into bite-sized pieces, which allows me to be <span class="emphasize">less overwhelmed</span> and instead to <span class="emphasize">take action</span>. 
      </p>

      <p>
         <span class="emphasize">human connection </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        While I might struggle a little working with people, I love working around people. I work much better at home when my parents are around - and I love working alongside my peers on campus. I know that I value a <span class="emphasize">positive culture</span> highly, and will place emphasis on this during my job search. 
      </p>

      <h4>
        values, empathy and self-awareness <br>in learning and programming
      </h4>
      <p>
        I think that our <span class="emphasize">values</span>, our <span class="emphasize">ability to connect</span> to others, and a good dose of <span class="emphasize">self-awareness</span> are important skills to possess throughout <span class="emphasize">all facets of life</span>. In learning and programming I feel that this knowledge is vital when understanding how to work with others, how to overcome our own barriers, and how to navigate our potential biases both within social interactions and when writing code.

      <h4>core learning surprises</h4>
      <p>
        The biggest surprise to me in core is just how ready I am to engage with my own <span class="emphasize">inner work</span> and just be really open to learning about myself - having been on a rollercoaster of a mental health journey over the past few years and really struggling to see progress. I have been <span class="emphasize">inspired by concepts</span> that I have learned, from <span class="emphasize">growth mindset</span> and <span class="emphasize">neuroplasticity</span>, to <span class="emphasize">EQ</span>, to learning to <span class="emphasize">'think like a developer'</span>. Taking on a mindset of growth and breaking down goals into practicable tasks has been a huge shift for me, one that I am very excited about!

      <h4>most challenging aspects of core learning</h4>
      <p>
        I’ve been a little <span class="emphasize">bored</span> or <span class="emphasize">frustrated</span> at times with some of the reflections and core learning in general - I’m really excited about coding and I just want to get to the tech aspects of the curriculum. It also takes a lot of energy to introspect and really dig into the foundations of ones inner self.

      <h4>my thoughts on why DA focuses so much on teaching core in a web dev course </h4>
      <p>
        I think Dev Academy focuses so much on <span class="emphasize">core</span> because it is an essential skill to have in the <span class="emphasize">workplace</span> - and makes both programming and learning more enjoyable and rewarding. I think Dev Academy would be on the same page as me if I were to say: You get more out of the <span class="emphasize">tech</span> (and life) if you put time into the <span class="emphasize">core</span>! 
      </p>

    <section>
      <h4>is core a waste of time? why or why not?</h4>
      <p>
        I think core contains important skills and concepts to learn about and practice. While tech skills can continue to be developed, I believe that this will be aided significantly by learning core skills early on. Additionally, core skills can improve <span class="emphasize">employability</span>, make <span class="emphasize">learning</span> more enjoyable and <span class="emphasize">reduce stress</span> and overwhelm when facing challenges.
