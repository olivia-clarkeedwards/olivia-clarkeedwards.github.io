### What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Like all good things, lets work our way from the outside to the treasure within, starting with... 

CSS Box Model 
- how we create layouts in our design 
- every HTML element is wrapped in a box that consists of four elements 
    1. Margin
    2. Border
    3. Padding 
    4. Treasure... hehe -- we usually refer to this as content! 

We can use these four elements to be specific about how much space we want around content, and also how far apart elements stay from one another. 

padding:  OR
padding-top: 
padding-bottom: 
padding-left: 
padding: right: 

4 values go clockwise 
2 values = top bottom AND sides 

#### Margin

- Defines the space between elements
- If margins overlap, the margin specification will determine the space between two objects
- Pushes objects away, clears area around object
- Transparent

#### Border 

specs for style, width color of element border 

- A border sits outside inside the margin. This defines the edge of the object itself
- Can be colored 

border styles 

dotted - Defines a dotted border
dashed - Defines a dashed border
solid - Defines a solid border
double - Defines a double border
groove - Defines a 3D grooved border. The effect depends on the border-color value
ridge - Defines a 3D ridged border. The effect depends on the border-color value
inset - Defines a 3D inset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
outset - Defines a 3D outset border. The effect depends on the border-color value
none - Defines no border
hidden 

The border-style property can have from one to four values (for the top border, right border, bottom border, and the left border).

Note: None of the OTHER CSS border properties (which you will learn more about in the next chapters) will have ANY effect unless the border-style property is set!

border-width property specifies the width of the four borders.
pre-defined values 
-  thin, medium, or thick:

border shorthand border-width, style, size 
can be used for whole border or just one side 

border-radius set using pixels 


#### Padding


#### Content
