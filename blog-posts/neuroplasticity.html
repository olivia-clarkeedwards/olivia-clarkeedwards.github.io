      <h4>neuroplasticity</h4>

      <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that neural connections are strengthened in our brain when we use them more. If we use the connections less, then they will weaken. This applies no matter how old or young we are. This is a powerful idea because it allows us to understand that we can learn new skills, habits and behaviours, if we put our mind to it.</p>

      <p>By understanding this principle, people open themselves to growth. By understanding that our skills and attributes are not set in stone, we are free to learn. We can let go of limiting beliefs that tell us that we just can’t do certain things.</p>

      <p>Neuroplasticity can be increased by practice, by making new skills or information contextually relevant, and by adopting a growth mindset, rather than holding a fixed idea of our capabilities. </p>

      <p>For me, understanding neuroplasticity is helpful, because the focus turns toward the process of change, rather than being a concrete way. Large abstract ways to be can be broken down into small increments. Practising coding or typing or being with others in particular ways over time will lead to being a better or faster programmer, or being a more loving, fulfilled and empathetic person. </p>

      <p>For more of a deep dive into the science and function of neuroplasticity, check out Very Well’s excellent article at this link: <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">What is neuroplasticity?</a></p>
