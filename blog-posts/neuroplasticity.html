        an exploration of how we can better understand the

      <h4>neuroplasticity</h4>

      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the idea that neural connections are strengthened in
        our brain when we use them more. If we use the connections less, then
        they will weaken. This applies no matter how old or young we are. This
        is a powerful idea because it allows us to understand that we can learn
        new skills, habits and behaviours, if we put our mind to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        By understanding this principle, people open themselves to growth. By
        understanding that our skills and attributes are not set in stone, we
        are free to learn. We can let go of limiting beliefs that tell us that
        we just can’t do certain things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neuroplasticity can be increased by practice, by making new skills or
        information contextually relevant, and by adopting a growth mindset,
        rather than holding a fixed idea of our capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        For me, understanding neuroplasticity is helpful, because the focus
        turns toward the process of change, rather than being a concrete way.
        Large abstract ways to be can be broken down into small increments.
        Practising coding or typing or being with others in particular ways over
        time will lead to being a better or faster programmer, or being a more
        loving, fulfilled and empathetic person.

      <h4>growth mindset</h4>

      <p>
        Growth mindset is the concept that our skills, knowledge and abilities
        are dynamic and malleable. Challenges are embraced as opportunities to
        learn, rather than insurmountable hurdles.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been thinking and adopting the growth mindset recently since
        being introduced to this content in the preparation curriculum for
        DevAcademy. Despite being aware of the ability to learn and grow for a
        long time, and of conceptually knowing the value of practice, I have
        struggled to really embody the change that I want to see in myself.
        However, learning about growth mindset has hit the spot. I no longer
        feel trapped within my current set of skills and abilities - rather, I
        am learning to see them as an ever adapting jetty from which to throw
        new nets into the unknown, fishing out pieces of driftwood from the
        water with which to build the jetty further.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incorporating the growth mindset into my learning journey, for me, means
        practising seeing challenges as opportunities, reaching out for help,
        breaking large abstract ideas down into small challenges, and
        understanding my skills and dynamic and fluid.
      </p>

      <h4>growth mindset and me</h4>
      <p>
        I see incorporating a growth mindset into my life as essential both
        within and outside of DevAcademy. As someone who struggles with
        perfectionism, it is easy to see things as very black and white -
        something is good enough or it isn’t, either I’m smart or I’m not etc.. While
        I have always rationally held a growth mindset, my subconscious has been
        stuck in a fixed mindset which does not serve me well. I am looking
        forward to shifting away from seeing challenges as threatening to seeing
        them as opportunities for growth, and am excited to see where this will
        take me.
