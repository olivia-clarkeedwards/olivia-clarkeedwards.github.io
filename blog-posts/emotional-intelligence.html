      <h4>what is EQ?</h4>
      <p>
        EQ is emotional intelligence. It is the perception, evaluation and use
        of emotions to increase self-awareness and build strong constructive
        connections with oneself and others. A hierarchy of EQ skills can be
        understood as follows (from basic to complex):
      </p>
      <div class="blog-list">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Perception of emotions</li>
          <li>Reasoning with emotions</li>
          <li>Understanding emotions</li>
          <li>Managing emotions</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>Emotional intelligence can be broken down into four key attributes:</p>

      <div class="blog-list">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            Self-management: healthily managing emotions and behaviours, taking
            initiative, upholding commitments and being adaptable
          </li>
          <li>
            Self-awareness: recognizing one's own strengths and limitations,
            understanding the effects of ones' emotions on ones' behaviour and
            self-confidence
          </li>
          <li>
            Social awareness: having empathy in understanding others needs,
            emotions and concerns, reading emotional queues adeptly, social
            comfort and recognition of group dynamics
          </li>
          <li>
            Relationship management: skill in developing and maintaining
            relationships, clear communication, ability to work well with,
            inspire and influence others, and conflict management
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h4>EQ versus IQ</h4>
      <p>
        EQ refers to emotional intellegence, whereas IQ is focussed on cognitive
        capacity and reasoning abilities. In simple terms, one might
        differentiate EQ as being "street smart" and IQ as being "book smart."
      </p>

      <p>
        Theorists suggest that intelligence is not a singular trait but
        constitutes many varying types of intelligence - emotional, social,
        intellectual, practical etc. Individuals may vary in their distribution
        of these different types of intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        While people refer to general intelligence the "g factor", some experts
        place extra focus on emotional intelligence or EQ, as they believe it
        plays a vital role in the way that people live and experience their
        lives. However, traditional intelligence tests focussed on IQ, which is
        meant to express a person's overall mental ability.
      </p>

      <p>IQ tests focus on:</p>
      <div class="blog-list">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Visual and spacial processing</li>
          <li>General knowledge of the world</li>
          <li>Fluid reasoning</li>
          <li>Working memory and short-term memory</li>
          <li>Quantitative reasoning</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>EQ tests, in contrast, focus on:</p>
      <div class="blog-list">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Identifying emotions</li>
          <li>Evaluating how others feel</li>
          <li>Controlling one's own emotions</li>
          <li>
            Facilitating social communication<br />
            through using emotions
          </li>
          <li>Ability to relate to others</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        Where IQ may describe skill in academic pursuits, critical thinking and
        logic, EQ may indicate prowess in self-awareness, motivation, empathy
        for oneself and others, and self-control.
