      <p>This plan will outline my <span class="emphasize">goals</span>, <span class="emphasize">commitments</span> and <span class="emphasize">expectations</span> for my time at DevAcademy<span class="emphasize"></span>. </p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>goals and career pathway</h4>

      <p>I want to start as a  in a <span class="emphasize">growth-focussed</span> environment - I see the people and mentors that I am surrounded by as vital to my learning. </p>

      <p>I aspire to develop my <span class="emphasize">skills</span>, pursue my <span class="emphasize">curiosity</span> and move into more <span class="emphasize">senior roles</span>.</p>

      <p>I would love to work for a <span class="emphasize">market-leader</span> and a company that is passionate about <span class="emphasize">best-practices</span>.</p>

      <p>I would like to work on products that <span class="emphasize">benefit peoples lives</span> and the world that we live in. </p>

      <p>Penultimately, I want to pursue the <span class="emphasize">$schmoney</span> - hence trying to learn as much as I can and developing excellence in my skillset and ability to learn. I am tired of being a broke student and I would like to build a <span class="emphasize">comfortable lifestyle</span> for myself, my family and those within my scope of influence.</p>

      <p>Overall, I would like to be a part of creating more space for <span class="emphasize">women</span> and other minorities in tech, and <span class="emphasize">empower others</span> that I work with to excel alongside me. </p>

      <h4>strengths and limitations</h4>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Strengths:</span></p>

      <p>I bring <span class="emphasize">passion</span>, <span class="emphasize">humour</span>, <span class="emphasize">curiosity</span> and an <span class="emphasize">honest work ethic</span> to my learning. I think that it will help me to tap into these strengths when things get more challenging - identifying bigger goals can help bring purpose to tasks that seem frustrating or trivial in the moment.</p>

      <p>I strive for <span class="emphasize">excellence</span> and <span class="emphasize">beauty</span> in all that I create. 
        While the downside of this is a blur into unhealthy perfectionism, I think this drives my learning and growth, and is a core part of my identity that I bring to everything I do.</p>

      <p>I hold <span class="emphasize">broad perspectives</span>, <span class="emphasize">social intelligence</span> and <span class="emphasize">kindness</span> as core values in my approach to the world. This breaks down barriers between myself and others. 
        I look forward to working on my co-working and team skills to bring these values into practical action. </p>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Limitations:</span></p>

      <p>The flipside of striving for excellence is a huge demand on myself created by <span class="emphasize">perfectionism</span>, which in its turn creates a <span class="emphasize">fear of being wrong</span> and <span class="emphasize">not knowing</span> everything. This is something I am hyper-aware of and am conscious of mediating. While for many "good-enough" is settling, for me it is a reminder that sometimes moving forward is more important than getting stuck in the details. </p>

      <p>I love to work by myself and value <span class="emphasize">independence</span>, which can be a challenge when working in a group setting. I often trust myself and my own judgement more than that of others, which can make it hard to take on constructive criticism, and also means that I take on responsibility for other people's work where I shouldn't.</p>

      <p>I found it interesting (and slightly amusing) that the last strength on my list in the VIA test was <span class="emphasize">modesty</span>. Although I do struggle with imposter syndrome, I can also be quite <span class="emphasize">self-absorbed</span> and self-confidant (perhaps overly confident). While this confidence can be positive, I can apply my high standards to others as well as myself, which results in me being quite judgemental, eek. I think I can have a large and fragile <span class="emphasize">ego</span>... definitely want to work on building humility in my identity.</p>

      <h4>skills  to develop</h4>

      <p>Firstly, I'd like to develop my skill in <span class="emphasize">collaborating</span>.
        The question that will drive this is: "How can I work with others effectively, share responsibility and uplift others around me, while remaining grounded in myself and my values?"</p>

      <p>Secondly, I would like to get better at receiving and taking on board <span class="emphasize">feedback</span>. This includes getting better at allowing myself to make mistakes in the first place. </p>

      <p>Thirdly, I would like to maintain the <span class="emphasize">routine</span> that I have started, and continue to prioritise my physical, mental and emotional well-being while I learn, both within and outside of the course.</p>


    </section>

    <section>

      <h4>managing my workload</h4>
      <p>I am committed to maintaining a strong <span class="emphasize">routine</span> with clear boundaries, in order to protect my physical, mental and emotional <span class="emphasize">well-being</span>. This includes daily exercise, mindfulness practice, reflection and continued work with my therapist, aswell as clear on and off times for being engaged with course work. </p>

      <p>I am committed to working with my <span class="emphasize">peers</span> in a respectful manner, recognising what I can learn from them and being open and patient in my approach when working collaboratively. I am committed to steering away from comparison with others, as this can be challenging for me. </p>

      <p>When things are building up and getting to me I am committed to approaching a facilitator for <span class="emphasize">guidance</span>, talking to a <span class="emphasize">friend</span>, working through things with my <span class="emphasize">therapist</span> or simply taking a break from my desk to refresh and get some <span class="emphasize">perspective</span>.</p>

      <p>I am committed to developing the skill of <span class="emphasize">asking questions</span> when I have them! Even if I might, then, find the answer to the question myself. </p>

      <span class="emphasize">optional emphasis</span>

    <section>

      <h4>facilitation team</h4>

      <p>I expect <span class="emphasize">respect </span> and <span class="emphasize">openness</span> from the Facilitation team in response to the expression of a need for support in technical or core challenges. 
        If unable to provide the help required, I would expect re-direction or <span class="emphasize">guidance</span> toward an appropriate resource.</p>

    <section>

      <h4>planned scheduling</h4>
      <p>I will be away for one or two days on Easter weekend for my <span class="emphasize">Poppa's 95th birthday</span>.</p>
      <p>I intend to take up <span class="emphasize">Muay Thai</span> classes a few times a week to maintain my physical fitness during bootcamp. This might require me to go train and then return to campus to work on course material, or perhaps get up early to go before the day begins.</p>
