      <h4>happy fam: HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h4>

      <p>Harry The Mad Lion, Clara So Stylish and Jamie-St-Claire are siblings who want to share engaging ideas with the world. They are confident in their mission, but know that in order to be successful, they must combine their individual skills together. </p>

      <p>Each sibling has different strengths, and is particularly good at doing what they do, but  Harry and Clara are particularly single-minded, so while they each excel in their particular skill and work well with one another, Jamie is the one who really gets things going when it comes to engaging with a community outside of the family.</p>

      <p>The oldest of the siblings, Harry is a stalwart intellectual - hard thinker, hard worker and for some strange reason loved to play tag a little too much as a child. While, as a skilled wordsmith, he excels at generating content, explaining concepts, and gathering images and resources together, he tends to think that presentation skills are all a bit fluffy and useless.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasize">Content is Harry's game</span>.</p>

      <p>As a second child, Clara appreciates Harry and is inspired by all his amazing ideas. Knowing that for others, these ideas might come across a little dry as presented by Harry, she has become a skilled artist, presenting his ideas to the world packaged up with wonderful style, expression and flair. She allows the world to engage with Harry’s ideas visually, without the hard work needed to engage with Harry directly.</p>
      
      <p><span class="emphasize"> Presentation is the word-of-the-day for Clara</span>.</p>
     
      <p>Jamie-St-Claire is the motivator, the doer, the activator of the family. Interaction, and dynamic engagement with ideas, really turns them on. Jamie sees the potential for engagement with Harry’s ideas beyond what Clara could ever imagine. Jamie connects people to Harry's ideas, and Clara’s presentation of those ideas, in a way that allows those ideas to come to life, to shift and change, right in the moment of interaction.</p>

      <p><span class="emphasize"> Active engagement is Jamie’s middle name (not literally… we all know their middle name is St, duh)</span>.</p>

      <p>Combining their skills, Harry The Mad Lion, Clara So Stylish and Jamie-St-Claire engage the world with beautifully presented  ideas and allow people to interactively engage with them. In the same way, <span class="emphasize">HTML</span>, <span class="emphasize">CSS</span> and <span class="emphasize">JavaScript</span> create beautiful websites, so that people can connect with ideas, systems or products in an engaging and easeful way. Like Harry, <span class="emphasize">HTML</span> provides the content; like Clara, <span class="emphasize">CSS</span> provides the styling; and, like Jamie-St-Claire, <span class="emphasize">JavaScript</span> provides real time interactivity between users and web content.</p>
